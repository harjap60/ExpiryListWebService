Note: Requires GSON maven library
Note: Only works if active server is up.

Running the program will bring up the GUI showing all the lists. There are tabs for the different types of lists.
Lists are automatically loaded from the spring boot server

The add button at the bottom of the gui is used to add new items to the expiry list
Clicking the add button will open a dialog which will let the user input different types of data.
The user will type in the name, notes, price and weight/volume. There is also a selector up top to choose the type
of the consumable. There is then another add button at the bottom, which if clicked, adds the new item to the server
if all the attributes entered are correct. If incorrect, a small message will popup.

For deleting there is a button in the main gui at the bottom right. It will redirect you to a custom dialog
with a list of all items. You choose a item number from the items and enter it at the bottom and click delete.
If the item number is valid the item is deleted from the server, otherwise a message pops up.

When leaving the add dialog and delete dialog, the program will auto populate all the lists again from the server

Closing the gui window will close the program and also prompt the server to save the items in a json file.
Server will still stay active.
